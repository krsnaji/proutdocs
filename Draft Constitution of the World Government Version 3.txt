SECTION III. WORLD GOVERNMENT

Article 55. Foundations of the World Government

The World Government is the highest coordinating body established to ensure peace, sustainable development, the protection of the rights of all people and living beings, equitable distribution of resources, and global order. Its mission is to ensure the balance of interests of all peoples, prevent conflicts, protect the environment, and promote social, economic, and cultural standards aimed at the well-being of all humanity.
The functioning of the World Government is based on the following principles:
Equality and Justice – ensuring equal opportunities and rights for all peoples and states, eliminating systemic inequalities in access to resources and influence on global processes.
Decentralization of Authority – transferring governance to regional and local levels to increase management efficiency and address the needs of all communities.
Separation of Political and Economic Power – preventing the concentration of influence and control over resources in the hands of a few entities, ensuring economic democracy and equitable distribution of benefits.
Transparency and Accountability – openness in all decision-making processes, citizens' access to information about government activities, and the possibility of public oversight.
Responsible Governance – prioritizing long-term decisions that consider the impacts on future generations, natural ecosystems, and the sustainability of society.
The structure of the World Government includes the following key boards:
The Supreme Board of Sadvipras – the main board responsible for strategic planning, making global decisions, and overseeing their implementation.
The Legislative Board of Sadvipras – the board that develops and approves global laws and regulations, ensures the observance of rights and freedoms, and regulates interactions between states.
The Executive Board of Sadvipras – responsible for implementing the approved decisions, managing international projects, and ensuring coordination between states and global institutions.
The Judicial Board of Sadvipras – the international justice system that oversees the enforcement of global laws, resolves disputes, and protects rights.
Specialized Boards oversee governance in key areas, including:
The Board for Economic Justice – coordinating resource distribution mechanisms, preventing economic exploitation, and regulating global financial flows.
The Board for Science and Technology – managing technological development, regulating its impact on society, and preventing risks related to uncontrolled technological progress.
The Board for Social Policy – developing and overseeing global standards in healthcare, education, human rights protection, and social programs.
The Board for the Environment – ensuring compliance with environmental standards, developing and coordinating international programs for nature protection and sustainable development.
The Board for Culture and Education – preserving cultural diversity, supporting languages, traditions, and global educational programs.

The activities of the World Government are based on the principles of transparency and democratic oversight. All decisions are subject to regular evaluation, public participation mechanisms are created, global consultations are held, and independent audits are conducted.
The relations between the World Government and its member states are built on the principles of equal cooperation. It does not interfere in the internal affairs of states except when human rights are violated, humanitarian catastrophes occur, or global threats arise that require collective action.
Territories of global significance, such as Antarctica, the World Ocean, and outer space, may be governed by the World Government in the interest of all humanity, with the goal of protecting natural resources, advancing scientific development, and preventing conflicts.
The Constitution of the World Government holds the highest legal authority and is binding on all member states, international organizations, and global institutions. Any laws, acts, or decisions that contradict its principles are considered legally null and void.
To ensure justice and legality, international mechanisms are established to oversee the activities of all World Government boards, as well as safeguards against the abuse of power, including independent expert commissions and international monitoring structures.

Article 56. Principles of Meritocracy in Global Governance

The appointment and activities of all officials in the structures of the World Government are based on the principles of meritocracy, according to which the key criteria are intellectual abilities, professional competence, moral qualities, and personal responsibility. These principles exclude the possibility of appointments based on political loyalty, personal connections, financial influence, or discriminatory factors.
All candidates for leadership and administrative positions undergo objective and transparent selection procedures, which include a comprehensive assessment of their professional skills, knowledge, leadership qualities, management abilities, and adherence to ethical standards. The selection procedure involves independent expert opinions, an analysis of previous achievements, competency testing, and public consultations.
An independent Ethics and Meritocracy Commission is established to oversee the appointment process, monitor compliance with professionalism standards, and prevent any forms of corruption, favoritism, or abuse of office. The Commission has the authority to initiate audits, recommend removal from office, conduct investigations, and refer materials to judicial bodies in the case of violations.
Corruption, favoritism, incompetence, use of office for personal gain, or violation of meritocratic principles are serious offenses, leading to immediate removal from office and legal accountability in accordance with international law.
All officials are subject to regular performance evaluations based on objective criteria, including the results of their activities, achievement of strategic goals, transparency of governance, public trust, and adherence to principles of fairness. Evaluations are conducted by independent expert commissions and civil auditors, and their results are open to public scrutiny.
Career advancement is carried out solely based on merit, confirmed by achievements and the effectiveness of management decisions. Preference is given to candidates who demonstrate outstanding strategic thinking, ethical leadership, innovative approaches, and the ability to effectively address global challenges.
The principles of meritocracy apply not only at the level of global governance but also in all areas of public life—from municipal administration to international organizations, economic, and social institutions. This creates unified standards of competence, managerial responsibility, and moral maturity for all those in leadership positions.
The World Government is obligated to implement professional development and continuous learning programs for all civil servants to ensure their ongoing qualification improvement, enhancement of management skills, and readiness to address contemporary challenges.
All decisions related to personnel policy are subject to mandatory public discussion, independent audit, and legal oversight, excluding the possibility of manipulation, closed appointments, and opaque influence.
The application of meritocratic principles is an essential condition for the functioning of fair, responsible, and effective global governance. Their violation threatens public trust and the stability of the political system, so any deviations from these standards must be curtailed at all levels of government.



Article 57. Global System of Economic Democracy

Economic democracy is the foundation of global governance, ensuring the fair distribution of resources, the elimination of economic inequality, and the creation of sustainable economic structures focused on the welfare of society. Economic activity should serve to meet the needs of all people, rather than enriching a small group of individuals.
The economic system is based on the principles of decentralization, where local communities are granted the right to autonomously manage their resources. Economic planning and distribution of goods are carried out through cooperative structures, public associations, and democratically elected economic councils, reflecting the interests of all participants.
All natural resources are the common heritage of humanity. Their use must be regulated in accordance with the principles of justice, sustainable development, and environmental responsibility. The privatization of strategically important natural resources, such as water, land, energy, and minerals, is prohibited.
Economic policy is aimed at supporting cooperative forms of ownership, local production, small and medium-sized businesses, and preventing the monopolization of key industries. Mechanisms are created to protect against the concentration of capital in the hands of a few individuals, excluding the possibility of exploiting economic systems for private interests.
The financial system is based on the principles of ethical economics, excluding speculative operations, the creation of artificial financial crises, excessive interest burdens, and any forms of financial manipulation. Lending and investments should promote the development of the real economy, social stability, and scientific progress.
Government investments and subsidies are directed to priority sectors that ensure the public good: healthcare, education, science, the environment, social security, infrastructure, and innovation.
To ensure global economic security, stabilization funds are created to prevent economic crises, natural and technological disasters, and to support the resilience of local economies. These funds are managed based on international mechanisms that exclude corruption and inefficient resource distribution.
Every person has the right to fair working conditions, just pay, social protection, and participation in the management of their working communities. Exploitation, forced labor, child labor, and discrimination in the workplace are strictly prohibited.
Economic policy encourages the development of environmentally friendly technologies, the green economy, and innovative solutions aimed at reducing the impact of economic activities on the environment. Government support is provided to enterprises that operate in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
One of the priorities of global economic policy is the elimination of poverty, closing the gap between developed and developing regions, and ensuring economic justice. International mechanisms are created to support economically disadvantaged regions, fostering equal living standards worldwide.
International trade and economic cooperation are regulated based on the principles of fairness, mutually beneficial exchange, and preventing unequal trade relations that lead to exploitation and worsen the situation of economically weaker countries.
The economic system must be open and accountable to citizens. Mechanisms for democratic control, public consultations, and regular audits of the economic activities of government and transnational entities are established.
The implementation of the principles of economic democracy is an essential condition for the functioning of the World Government. Any economic models that lead to oppression, exploitation, the growth of social inequality, or environmental destruction are considered incompatible with the principles of fair governance.
